Barcelona's most iconic places

The main purpose of my website is to let people, who visit the website,  know the most iconic places of Barcelona.
In it, we can find the description of each place with images and where is it located. Moreover, 
there will be a part in the website where people, who already visited the place, will be able to 
contribute their thoughts about it. This website will facilitate people to look for the best places in Barcelona.
